# biasFairnessDemo

A compact, self-contained demonstration notebook for **bias and fairness analysis in supervised machine learning**.

This repository provides a hands-on workflow for:
- training a baseline classifier,
- inspecting performance across sensitive groups,
- computing fairness indicators,
- and exploring how different modeling choices affect **accuracy–fairness trade-offs**.

The demo is implemented as a single Jupyter notebook and uses the **Adult Income dataset**.

## What this demo illustrates

Bias and fairness issues can appear even when a model performs well globally. Typical patterns include:
- systematic performance differences between demographic groups (e.g., higher false negative rates for one group),
- disparate rates of positive predictions (disparate impact),
- indirect discrimination caused by correlated features (proxy variables).

This notebook guides through a fairness audit in a transparent, didactic way:
1. **Train a baseline model**
2. **Measure group-wise outcomes**
3. **Quantify fairness criteria**
4. **Discuss trade-offs and mitigation strategies**
